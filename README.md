Markdown Graphs

Just a simple web front end for JS seqence diagrams at the moment

Goal is to embed these in Github wiki markdown, like:

```
![Example Graph](http://uml.example.com/sequence/simple/
Title:Example Graph
participant Client
participant Server
Client->Server: Hey man
Server->Client: Yo Yo
)
```
